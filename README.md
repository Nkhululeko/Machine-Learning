# Simple Machine Learning Example

This repository demonstrates a simple machine learning example using the scikit-learn library. It includes a basic classification model to classify iris flowers based on their features.

## Description

This example uses the Iris dataset, which is a well-known dataset for classification tasks. We use a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to train the model and evaluate its performance.

### Files

- `code.py`: Python script containing the machine learning code.
